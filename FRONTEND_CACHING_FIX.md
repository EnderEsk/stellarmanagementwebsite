# Frontend Caching Fix

## Problem Description

The system was experiencing an issue where quote and invoice data was being cached in the frontend JavaScript variables (`currentQuoteData` and `currentInvoiceData`). This caused:

1. **Persistent Data**: Previous booking data would persist when creating new quotes/invoices
2. **Incorrect Totals**: Form fields would show previous totals instead of starting fresh
3. **Data Confusion**: Users would see old customer information when starting new transactions
4. **Manual Refresh Required**: Users had to refresh the page to get clean data

## Root Cause

The frontend JavaScript was storing quote and invoice data in global variables that weren't being cleared between different bookings:

- `currentQuoteData` - Stored quote information
- `currentInvoiceData` - Stored invoice information
- Form fields were being populated from cached data instead of fresh booking data

## Solution Implemented

### Changes Made

1. **Added `clearCachedData()` Function**:
   - Clears `currentQuoteData` and `currentInvoiceData` variables
   - Called when loading bookings, closing modals, and starting new transactions

2. **Added `clearFormFields()` Function**:
   - Clears all quote and invoice form fields
   - Resets service item containers
   - Resets tax toggles
   - Called on page load and when needed

3. **Modified `closeModal()` Function**:
   - Now clears cached data when closing quote or invoice modals
   - Ensures clean state for next transaction

4. **Modified `loadNewQuote()` Function**:
   - Clears cached data before starting new quote
   - Ensures fresh start for each quote

5. **Modified `showInvoiceModal()` Function**:
   - Clears cached data before showing invoice modal
   - Ensures fresh start for each invoice

6. **Modified `loadBookings()` Function**:
   - Clears cached data when loading bookings
   - Ensures clean state when switching between bookings

### New Workflow

**Before Fix:**
```
1. Create Booking A → Quote shows Booking A data
2. Create Booking B → Quote still shows Booking A data (cached)
3. Refresh page → Quote shows Booking B data (fresh)
```

**After Fix:**
```
1. Create Booking A → Quote shows Booking A data
2. Create Booking B → Quote shows Booking B data (fresh, no cache)
3. No refresh needed → Always shows current booking data
```

## Benefits

1. **Fresh Data**: Each new quote/invoice starts with clean data
2. **No Manual Refresh**: Users don't need to refresh the page
3. **Accurate Totals**: Form fields always show correct starting values
4. **Clean State**: No data persistence between different bookings
5. **Better UX**: Seamless workflow without interruptions

## Testing Results

### Before Fix
- Quote/invoice forms showed previous booking data
- Totals were carried over from previous transactions
- Required page refresh to get clean data
- Confusing user experience

### After Fix
- Quote/invoice forms show current booking data
- Totals start fresh for each transaction
- No page refresh required
- Clean, predictable user experience

## Example

**Before Fix:**
```
Booking A: $500 quote → Form shows $500
Booking B: New booking → Form still shows $500 (cached)
Refresh page → Form shows $0 (fresh)
```

**After Fix:**
```
Booking A: $500 quote → Form shows $500
Booking B: New booking → Form shows $0 (fresh, no cache)
No refresh needed → Always shows correct data
```

## Impact

- ✅ **Fixed**: Quote/invoice forms start fresh for each booking
- ✅ **Fixed**: No more cached data persistence
- ✅ **Fixed**: Accurate totals and customer information
- ✅ **Fixed**: No manual page refresh required
- ✅ **Maintained**: All existing functionality remains intact

## Technical Details

### Functions Added
