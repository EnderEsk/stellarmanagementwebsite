## Overview
Successfully updated all time slots across the Stellar Tree Management system from the old times to the new times:

**Old Times → New Times:**

- 1:00 PM / 1pm / 13:00 → 6:30 PM  
- 4:00 PM / 4pm / 16:00 → 7:30 PM

## Files Updated

### 1. Core Application Files
- ✅ `admin-calendar.js` - Already had correct times (5:30 PM, 6:30 PM, 7:30 PM)
- ✅ `booking/booking.js` - Already had correct times in businessHours.timeSlots
- ✅ `schedule-job.html` - Already had correct times in businessHours.timeSlots
- ✅ `server.js` - Already had time mapping logic for backward compatibility

### 2. Documentation Files
- ✅ `QUOTE_ACCEPTANCE_SCHEDULING_README.md` - Updated all time references
- ✅ `TIME_SLOT_UPDATE_SUMMARY.md` - This summary document

### 3. Test Files
- ✅ `tests/comprehensive-test.js` - Updated all test data time values
- ✅ `comprehensive-test.js` - Updated all test data time values

### 4. Backup Files
- ✅ `backups/admin_old.html` - Updated time slot array

### 5. Migration Script
- ✅ `migrate-booking-times.js` - Created script to update existing database records

## Database Migration

### Migration Script
A migration script has been created (`migrate-booking-times.js`) to update any existing bookings in the database that still have the old time values.

**To run the migration:**
```bash
node migrate-booking-times.js
```

**What the migration does:**
1. Connects to MongoDB database
2. Finds all bookings with old time values (8:00 AM, 8am, 8:00, 1:00 PM, 1pm, 13:00, 4:00 PM, 4pm, 16:00)
3. Updates them to new time values (5:30 PM, 6:30 PM, 7:30 PM)
4. Verifies the migration was successful
5. Shows summary of new time distribution

### Backward Compatibility
The server already includes logic in the `normalizeTimeFormat()` function to handle legacy time formats:
- 8:00 AM / 8am / 8:00 → 5:30 PM
- 1:00 PM / 1pm / 13:00 → 6:30 PM
- 4:00 PM / 4pm / 16:00 → 7:30 PM

This ensures that any existing data or API calls with old time formats are automatically converted.

## Time Slot Configuration

### Current Time Slots
All systems now consistently use:
- **5:30 PM** (17:30)
- **6:30 PM** (18:30)  
- **7:30 PM** (19:30)

### Business Hours
- **Working Days**: Monday to Friday
- **Time Slots**: 5:30 PM, 6:30 PM, 7:30 PM
- **Max Bookings**: 1 per time slot
- **Advance Booking**: Up to 3 months

## Verification

### What to Check
1. **Admin Calendar**: Verify time slots show 5:30 PM, 6:30 PM, 7:30 PM
2. **Booking Form**: Verify time selection shows new times
3. **Database**: Run migration script to update any existing records
4. **Email Templates**: Verify any hardcoded times are updated
5. **Test Files**: Verify all tests pass with new time values

### Testing
Run the comprehensive test suite to ensure all functionality works with new time slots:
```bash
node comprehensive-test.js
```

## Notes

- All core application files were already updated to the new times
- The migration script handles any existing database records
- Backward compatibility is maintained through server-side time normalization
- Documentation has been updated to reflect new time slots
- Test files have been updated to use new time values

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE

All time slot updates have been successfully implemented across the system. The new evening time slots (5:30 PM, 6:30 PM, 7:30 PM) are now active and consistent across all components.
