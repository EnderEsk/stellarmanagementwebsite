# Save Quote Button Fix

## Problem Description

After implementing the frontend caching fix, the "Save Quote" button stopped working. The issue was that the `clearCachedData()` function was being called too aggressively, which cleared the `currentQuoteData` variable before the quote could be saved.

## Root Cause

The problem occurred because:

1. **Aggressive Cache Clearing**: The `clearCachedData()` function was being called in `loadNewQuote()` and `showInvoiceModal()`, which cleared `currentQuoteData` immediately
2. **Missing Booking Data**: The `generateQuote()` function requires `currentQuoteData.bookingId` to save the quote, but this was being cleared
3. **Timing Issue**: The cache was being cleared before the quote data could be properly set

## Solution Implemented

### Changes Made

1. **Modified `loadNewQuote()` Function**:
   - Removed the immediate `clearCachedData()` call
   - Added proper `currentQuoteData` initialization with booking information
   - Ensures the booking data is available for quote saving

2. **Modified `showInvoiceModal()` Function**:
   - Removed the immediate `clearCachedData()` call
   - Allows invoice data to be properly set before any clearing

3. **Added `clearCachedDataForBooking()` Function**:
   - More selective cache clearing that only clears data for different bookings
   - Preserves data for the current booking being worked on

4. **Modified `showQuoteModal()` Function**:
   - Added selective cache clearing only when switching to a different booking
   - Preserves current booking data when working on the same booking

5. **Modified `closeModal()` Function**:
   - Removed automatic cache clearing when closing modals
   - Keeps data available for the current booking

### New Workflow

**Before Fix:**
```
1. Open Quote Modal → clearCachedData() called immediately
2. Fill in quote details → currentQuoteData is null
3. Click Save Quote → Error: currentQuoteData.bookingId is undefined
```

**After Fix:**
```
1. Open Quote Modal → currentQuoteData set with booking info
2. Fill in quote details → currentQuoteData preserved
3. Click Save Quote → Success: currentQuoteData.bookingId available
```

## Benefits

1. **Working Save Button**: Quote saving functionality is restored
2. **Preserved Data**: Current booking data is maintained during quote creation
3. **Selective Clearing**: Cache is only cleared when switching between different bookings
4. **Better UX**: No more broken save functionality
5. **Clean State**: Still prevents data persistence between different bookings

## Testing Results

### Before Fix
- Save Quote button did not work
- `currentQuoteData` was null when trying to save
- Error: "Cannot read property 'bookingId' of null"

### After Fix
- Save Quote button works correctly
- `currentQuoteData` is properly set with booking information
- Quote saving process completes successfully

## Example

**Before Fix:**
```
Booking A → Open Quote → clearCachedData() → currentQuoteData = null
Fill Quote → Click Save → Error: bookingId undefined
```

**After Fix:**
```
Booking A → Open Quote → currentQuoteData = {bookingId: "ST-123", ...}
Fill Quote → Click Save → Success: Quote saved with bookingId
```

## Impact

- ✅ **Fixed**: Save Quote button now works correctly
- ✅ **Fixed**: Quote data is properly preserved during creation
- ✅ **Fixed**: No more null reference errors
- ✅ **Maintained**: Cache clearing still works when switching bookings
- ✅ **Maintained**: All existing functionality remains intact

## Technical Details

### Functions Modified
- `loadNewQuote()` - Removed aggressive cache clearing, added proper data initialization
- `showInvoiceModal()` - Removed aggressive cache clearing
- `showQuoteModal()` - Added selective cache clearing
- `closeModal()` - Removed automatic cache clearing

### Functions Added
- `clearCachedDataForBooking()` - Selective cache clearing for different bookings

### Data Flow
1. **Quote Modal Opens** → `currentQuoteData` set with booking info
2. **User Fills Quote** → Data preserved in `currentQuoteData`
3. **User Saves Quote** → `currentQuoteData.bookingId` available for saving
4. **Switch to Different Booking** → Cache cleared for new booking

The fix ensures that the quote saving functionality works correctly while still maintaining the benefits of the frontend caching fix for preventing data persistence between different bookings.
